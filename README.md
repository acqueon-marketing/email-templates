This is where all the custom newsletter templates are written.

### Introduction ###

The newsletter templates are standard html pages. For a quick dev workflow a yo generator has been used. It is a boilerplate for basic html-sass workflow([reference](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-gulp-scss-html-boilerplate)).


### Instructions ###

* For every new email template always use a new branch. The branch should have the following naming convention - 
`project-name-separated-by-hyphens_month-year`, eg. for the project name to be Noble Campaign of June, 2022, the branch name should be `noble-campaign_jun-2022`.
* Create a new html file with an appropriate name for the template inside the `src` folder and voila !
